- 1.6 Higher Order Functions
    - using summation function as an example
        - you can have multiple types of summations (depends on the expression you want)
        - how do you remove all this boilerplate code like looping i=0, to n?
        - the thing that changes (express) can be passed in as an argument. This expression is itself a function which takes in variables as an argument
    - another example is calculating pi. You have multiple area formulas for different shapes, You can abstract it to area(radius, expression) where radius*radius*expression and expression is the function of the different shapes you want to pass in. 
    - passing in functions as a parameter (higher order functions)
    - returning functions
        - 
    - lambda functions
